# K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project uses K-Means clustering to group customers into segments based on purchasing behaviour. The goal is to explore unsupervised learning and cluster interpretation.

## Objectives
- Scale features for distance-based clustering  
- Apply the Elbow Method to choose optimal K  
- Perform clustering and assign cluster labels  
- Visualize cluster separation  

## Dataset
Customer dataset containing:
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  

## Workflow Summary
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Scale numerical features  

2. **Elbow Method**
   - Determine optimal number of clusters  

3. **Clustering**
   - Train KMeans model  
   - Predict cluster labels  

4. **Visualisation**
   - 2D scatter plots  
   - Cluster centroids  

## Results
- Model identified clear spending-based clusters.
- Useful for customer segmentation and marketing insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn
